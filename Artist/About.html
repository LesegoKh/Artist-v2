                <p class="sentence" id="word">Kimathi Mafafo, (b. 1984, Kimberly, Northern Cape, South Africa) is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice ranges from embroidery, oil painting to installation. Mafafo obtained a National Diploma in Fine Arts from the College of Cape Town in 2007 and a National Diploma in Film and Video from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in 2016.<br> 
                <br> Born in the semi-arid Kimberley in the Northern Cape of South Africa, Mafafo questions historical stereotypes around gender inequality in Africa. She primarily focuses on celebrating the black female and abstracted forms placing them in often verdant imaging characterised by lush greenery and sensuous drapery, that are far removed from the dusty mining town where she grew up. The artist has recently organized a group of Capetonian woman into an informal traditional embroidery society.</p>
